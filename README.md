# FreesideHack_6.11

The problem I solved at the Freeside Hackathon no 6/11 is below:


Sub­Diagonal Paths (prob2)

The Problem :

You are to find all of the paths on the bottom diagonal of a n x n grid. The path must only go

from left­to­right or bottom­to­top. Given a dimension of the grid (ex. n = 4), specify the number

of such paths (ex. solution = 14).
